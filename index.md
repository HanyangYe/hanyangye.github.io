## About

My name is Hanyang Ye, 叶涵洋 in Chinese. My close friends call me my nickname Andrew. I am from Shangyu District, Shaoxing City in China. I graduated from the University of Oxford as a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics, supervised by [Dr. Moritz Riede](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/riede). My research interests in physics include organic semiconductors, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting devices (OLED), biomaterials, and bio-sensors. In the meanwhile, I was trained in private equity investment in Saïd Business School at the University of Oxford ([Oxford Saïd Finance Lab](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/oxford-mba/academic-curriculum/oxford-said-finance-lab)). I am interested in PE/VC investment, entrepreneurship, and related research. I was a 2016-2017 corhort member of [The Oxford Global Leadership Initiative Programme](https://oxfordcharacter.org/leadership/student-profiles). Apart from the University of Oxford, I am an alumnus of Zhejiang University (I was the former vice-president of the [Zhejiang University Alumni Association in UK](http://zjuaa.org.uk/)), Uppsala University, Western University, and the [China Oxford Scholarship Fund](https://chinaoxford.org/)(for which I am volunteering as an alumnni co-ordinator in the mainland China). In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, photography (amateur photographer and award-winner), hiking, and dancing (Medallist in Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match). I have been writing a blog called "[逆旅札记](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/nilvzhaji)", in which I discuss about the world I observe.
