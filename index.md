## About

My name is Hanyang Ye, 叶涵洋 in Chinese, a.k.a. Andrew. I am an investment manager at Huaneng Guicheng Trust Corp.,Ltd. I specialize in the investment of sustainable energy, semiconductor, advanced manufacture, etc, with a focus on sustainable energy. I base in Beijing City, China. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford as a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics ([AFMD Group](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/afmd-group)). My research interests in physics include organic semiconductors, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting devices (OLED), biomaterials, and bio-sensors. In the meanwhile, I was trained in private equity investment in the Saïd Business School ([Oxford Saïd Finance Lab](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/programmes/oxford-mba/academic-curriculum/oxford-said-finance-lab)). I was a 2016-2017 cohort member of [The Oxford Global Leadership Initiative Programme](https://oxfordcharacter.org/leadership/student-profiles). And I am volunteering as an alumni mentor for MentorNet at Oxford University since December, 2022. 

Apart from the University of Oxford, I am an alumnus of Zhejiang University (former vice-president of [Zhejiang University Alumni Association in UK](http://zjuaa.org.uk/)), Uppsala University, Western University, and [China Oxford Scholarship Fund](https://chinaoxford.org/) (for which I am volunteering as an alumni co-ordinator). In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, photography, and hiking. I have been writing a blog called "[逆旅札记](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/nilvzhaji)".
