## Welcome to Hanyang Ye's personal website

My name is Hanyang Ye, 叶涵洋 in Chinese. My close friends call me my nickname Andrew. I graduated from the University of Oxford as a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics. My research interests include organic semiconductors, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting devices, biomaterials, and bio-sensors. In my spare time, I am also interested in private equalty investment.
