## About

My name is Hanyang Ye, 叶涵洋 in Chinese. My close friends call me my nickname Andrew. I am from Shangyu District, Shaoxing City in China. I graduated from the University of Oxford as a DPhil in Condensed Matter Physics. My research interests include organic semiconductors, organic solar cells, organic light-emitting devices, biomaterials, and bio-sensors. In the meanwhile, I am trained in private equity investment in Said Business School of the University of Oxford. And I am a 2016-2017 corhort member of [The Oxford Global Leadership Initiative Programme](https://oxfordcharacter.org/leadership/student-profiles). Apart from the University of Oxford, I am an alumnus of Zhejiang University, Uppsala University, Western University, and [China Oxford Scholarship Fund](https://chinaoxford.org/). In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, photography, hiking, and dancing. I have been writing a casual blog called "逆旅札记" (mainly in Chinese) in my Zhihu account.
